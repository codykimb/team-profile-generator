  ---
##  DESCRIPTION  
  ##### This project is a Node.js command-line application that uses the Inquirer and Jest packages to take in information about employees on a software engineering team and generate an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. The user created page will be pushed to ./dist. There is a sample myteam.html created using the app to view in ./dist as well and there are unit tests for each part of the code in ./__tests__.
